FINAL THOUGHTS
--------------

This story demonstrates that effective thrillers don't always need exotic locations or superhuman protagonists. The corporate world provides plenty of realistic high-stakes scenarios where ordinary people can find themselves in extraordinary danger. Sarah's victory comes through intelligence, preparation, and professional expertise rather than physical prowess, making her a more relatable and inspiring character for readers.

The family connection with her FBI brother adds a personal touch while providing a realistic resolution mechanism. The story balances technical accuracy with accessibility, ensuring readers understand the stakes without getting bogged down in jargon.

Key takeaway: Modern thrillers can find as much tension in server rooms and corporate boardrooms as in traditional action settings, provided the human stakes remain clear and the characters stay grounded in reality.
