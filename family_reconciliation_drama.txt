THE WEIGHT OF YEARS

Sarah's heels clicked against the hospital's linoleum floor with mechanical precision, each step echoing the rhythm of her rehearsed composure. She rounded the corner to the oncology wing and stopped short. There, slouched in a plastic chair outside room 314, sat a man she barely recognized as her brother.

Michael looked up from his phone, and for a moment, fifteen years collapsed into nothing. Same dark hair, though longer now and touched with early gray. Same green eyes, though lined with fatigue she didn't remember. But everything else—the beard, the worn leather jacket, the careful way he stood as if unsure of his welcome—marked him as a stranger.

"Sarah." His voice was rougher than she remembered.

"Michael." She clutched her purse strap tighter. "How long have you been here?"

"Since yesterday. Got the call from Dr. Martinez on Tuesday." He gestured toward their father's room. "He's sleeping now. The morphine helps with the pain."

Sarah nodded, professional and distant. "I flew in this morning. How bad is it?"

"Six weeks, maybe two months if he responds to treatment." Michael's voice caught slightly. "He asked for both of us, Sarah. Specifically. Said he needed to see us together."

The word 'together' hung between them like an accusation. Sarah moved past him toward the room, but Michael's hand caught her arm gently.

"We should probably... talk first. Before we go in there."

Sarah pulled away, but didn't disagree. They walked to the waiting room in silence, taking seats on opposite sides of a small table scattered with outdated magazines.

"So," Sarah said, arranging her blazer. "How have you been?"

Michael almost smiled. "Really? We're doing this?"

"Doing what?"

"Pretending the last fifteen years didn't happen."

Sarah's composure cracked slightly. "I'm trying to be civil."

"Civil." Michael leaned back. "Right. Because God forbid we actually feel something."

"Don't." Sarah's voice sharpened. "Don't you dare start this. You're the one who left, Michael. You're the one who walked away from this family like we meant nothing."

"I was twenty-three years old!" The words burst out of him. "I was trying to figure out my life, and everyone—you included—acted like I was some kind of criminal because I didn't want the life Dad had planned for me."

"You were throwing your life away! College, your future—"

"My future according to who? You? Dad?" Michael's eyes flashed. "I wasn't you, Sarah. I couldn't just follow the program and be happy."

Sarah stood abruptly. "The program? You mean responsibility? Growing up?"

"I mean living someone else's dreams!" Michael stood too, facing her across the small table. "You never understood that, did you? You were so busy being perfect, being everything they wanted, that you couldn't see how suffocating it was for the rest of us."

"Suffocating?" Sarah's voice rose. "They loved us, Michael. They sacrificed everything—"

"And you think I don't know that?" Michael's voice broke slightly. "You think I don't carry that every single day? But love isn't supposed to come with conditions, Sarah. It's not supposed to disappear the moment you make choices people don't like."

Sarah stared at him, her anger warring with something she didn't want to name. "You made it disappear. You stopped calling. You stopped coming home."

"Because home stopped feeling like home." The words came out quietly, devastatingly honest. "Because every conversation became a lecture about how I was disappointing everyone. Because you looked at me like I was a stranger who'd stolen your real brother."

Before Sarah could respond, a nurse appeared in the doorway. "Excuse me, are you the Chen children? Your father is awake and asking for you."

They followed the nurse down the hall in heavy silence. Robert Chen looked impossibly small in the hospital bed, his skin papery and pale. But his eyes brightened when he saw them.

"My children," he whispered, reaching out with trembling hands. Sarah took his right hand; after a moment's hesitation, Michael took his left.

"I need to tell you something," Robert said, his voice stronger than his appearance suggested. "Something I should have said a long time ago."

He looked at Michael first. "I was wrong, son. When you left, I was so angry, so afraid you were making a mistake, that I forgot to trust you. I forgot to trust the man we raised you to be."

Michael's jaw tightened, but he didn't pull away.

Robert turned to Sarah. "And you, my dear one. I let you carry the weight of being perfect for all of us. I put you in the middle, asked you to choose sides when there should have been no sides to choose."

Sarah felt tears threatening. "Dad—"

"Let me finish." His grip tightened on both their hands. "I am dying, and I will not die with my children hating each other because of my mistakes. You were both trying to love me in the only ways you knew how. But love should have been enough. Love should have been bigger than my expectations."

The room fell silent except for the steady beep of monitors. Robert looked between his children, then slowly brought their joined hands together over his chest.

"You are brother and sister," he whispered. "You are the best parts of each other. Don't let an old man's pride keep you from knowing that."

After their father fell back asleep, Sarah and Michael found themselves alone in the corridor again. The weight of his words settled around them like dust after a storm.

"I'm sorry," Sarah said finally, her voice barely audible. "I'm sorry I made you choose between your family and your life."

Michael's shoulders sagged. "I'm sorry I made it so easy for you to let me go."

They stood there, two middle-aged siblings rediscovering each other across a chasm of years. Sarah thought of all the Christmas mornings Michael had missed, all the phone calls that never came, all the ways she'd convinced herself she didn't miss him.

"Tell me about your life," she said. "The real version, not the one I imagined."

Michael looked surprised, then cautiously hopeful. "It's not what Dad wanted. I teach high school English now. In Portland. I'm married—her name is Elena. We have a daughter."

"A daughter?" Sarah's breath caught. "I have a niece?"

"Lily. She's eight." Michael pulled out his phone, showing Sarah a picture of a gap-toothed girl with Michael's eyes and dark pigtails. "She wants to be a veterinarian or a dragon trainer, depending on the day."

Sarah laughed despite herself, the first genuine laugh she'd had in months. "She's beautiful. She looks like you did at that age."

"Stubborn like me too, according to Elena." Michael smiled, then grew serious. "I wanted to call so many times, Sarah. Especially when Lily was born. But I didn't know how to bridge all those years."

"Neither did I." Sarah touched the photo gently. "I have pictures too. Of the last fifteen years. Maybe... maybe we could share them? Fill in the gaps?"

Michael nodded, his eyes bright with unshed tears. "I'd like that."

As they walked back toward their father's room, Sarah felt something shift inside her chest—a loosening of a knot she'd carried so long she'd forgotten its weight. They had lost fifteen years, but they had found each other again. And maybe, she thought, that was enough to start rebuilding what had been broken.

Outside room 314, Michael stopped and turned to her. "Thank you," he said simply.

"For what?"

"For being willing to try again."

Sarah reached out and hugged her brother for the first time in fifteen years, feeling how he'd changed and grown, but also recognizing the boy who used to build blanket forts with her and steal cookies from their mother's jar. Some things, she realized, never really change. Some things are worth fighting to get back.

"We're going to be okay," she whispered against his shoulder.

"Yeah," Michael whispered back. "I think we are."
