The Last Table

Maya had claimed the corner table by the window every Tuesday morning for three months now. It was her sanctuary—laptop open, steam rising from her ceramic mug, the gentle hum of conversation providing the perfect background for her writing. The Grind, tucked between a used bookstore and a vintage clothing shop, had become her second home since moving to the city.

She was deep in concentration, fingers dancing across the keyboard, when a familiar voice made her look up.

"Maya? Maya Chen?"

Standing beside her table was someone she hadn't seen in four years. Tall, still lean but more filled out than she remembered, with the same warm brown eyes that used to make her stomach flutter in college. His dark hair was shorter now, more professional, but that crooked smile was exactly the same.

"David." Her voice came out smaller than she intended. "Hi."

"I can't believe it's you." He shifted his weight, holding a coffee cup that read 'David' in the barista's careful handwriting. "Do you mind if I...?" He gestured to the empty chair across from her.

Maya's heart did something complicated. "Of course not."

David settled into the chair, and suddenly the spacious coffee shop felt intimate. "I heard you moved to Seattle," he said. "But I never thought I'd actually run into you."

"Small world, I guess." Maya closed her laptop halfway, creating a barrier but not quite shutting him out. "What brings you to The Grind?"

"I work a few blocks over now. Marketing for a tech startup." He paused, studying her face. "You look good, Maya. Really good."

She felt heat rise to her cheeks. "Thanks. You too."

An awkward silence stretched between them, filled with the weight of their history. They'd dated for two years in college, had talked about futures that included each other, until Maya got accepted to graduate school in Chicago and David landed his dream job in Portland. The long distance had seemed impossible then, their breakup inevitable if not exactly mutual.

"So what are you doing in Seattle?" David asked, genuine curiosity in his voice.

"Writing, actually. Freelance journalism, some copywriting to pay the bills." Maya gestured to her laptop. "I'm working on a piece about local coffee culture, which is why I spend so much time here."

"That's amazing. You always said you wanted to write professionally." His smile was proud, not the polite kind but genuinely pleased for her success. "I remember your article about the campus food trucks that got picked up by that magazine."

Maya blinked, surprised he remembered. "You read that?"

"I read everything you published in the college paper." David's ears reddened slightly. "Maybe that's weird to admit now."

"It's not weird," Maya said softly. "It's sweet."

They talked for an hour. David told her about his move to Seattle six months ago, how he'd been meaning to explore more of the neighborhood but kept getting caught up in work. Maya found herself laughing at his stories about learning to navigate the city's hills on his bike, the way she used to laugh when they'd spend entire afternoons talking in the quad.

"I should probably let you get back to your article," David said eventually, though he made no move to leave.

"Actually," Maya surprised herself by saying, "I could use a break. Want to walk around the neighborhood? I could show you some good spots for your weekend exploring."

David's face lit up. "I'd love that."

They wandered through Pike Place Market, David marveling at the flower vendors while Maya pointed out her favorite lunch spots. When they passed a small bookstore, David insisted on buying her a notebook he said reminded him of her—leather-bound with lined pages, perfect for jotting down story ideas.

"You remembered," Maya said, running her fingers over the cover. In college, she'd always carried a notebook for sudden inspiration.

"I remembered a lot of things." David's voice was quiet.

They ended up on a bench overlooking Elliott Bay, the afternoon sun casting everything in golden light. Maya had forgotten how easy it was to talk to David, how he listened with his whole attention and asked questions that made her think.

"Can I ask you something?" David said, turning to face her on the bench.

Maya nodded.

"Do you ever wonder what would have happened if we'd tried harder? Back then, I mean."

Maya's breath caught. "All the time," she admitted. "Especially when I first moved here and didn't know anyone."

"I looked you up on social media more times than I care to admit," David said with a self-deprecating laugh. "But I could never figure out what to say. 'Hey, remember me? I'm sorry I was too scared to fight for us?'"

"You weren't the only one who was scared," Maya said. "I could have called too."

They sat in comfortable silence, watching a ferry make its way across the sound.

"I know this might be presumptuous," David said finally, "but would you like to have dinner sometime? Not as exes trying to figure things out, just... as two people who used to know each other really well and maybe want to know each other again?"

Maya felt something settle in her chest, a kind of rightness she hadn't experienced in years. "I'd like that. But I have one condition."

"What's that?"

"We meet at The Grind first. That corner table has good luck."

David's grin was answer enough.

Three months later, Maya still claimed the corner table every Tuesday morning. But now David joined her, bringing two coffees and the crossword puzzle from the morning paper. They'd learned each other again slowly—her new love of hiking, his newfound skill at cooking, the ways they'd both grown and the ways they'd stayed fundamentally the same.

"Question for you," David said one Tuesday, setting down their usual orders. "What's a five-letter word for 'destiny'?"

Maya looked up from her laptop, where she was putting the finishing touches on her coffee shop article. She glanced around The Grind—at the baristas who now knew their names, at the window where they'd first talked again, at the man across from her who'd somehow found his way back into her life.

"Fated," she said, smiling. "Definitely fated."
